Exercises and answer sheets are included after all subsections to practice techniques and provide future reference examples. \r\n\r\nCourse material and exercises are available to view as rendered HTML at http://mrccsc.github.io/Reproducible_R.  \r\nAll material is available to download under GPL v2 license.\r\n\r\nFor  information on other courses run by our team see our [github IO page](http://mrccsc.github.io/training/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Team\r\nThis course was created and conducted by the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre Bioinformatics Team at Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital.  \r\nFor more information on the team see our [github IO page](http://mrccsc.github.io/).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis course is free for MRC CSC and Imperial staff and students.
